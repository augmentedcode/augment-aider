        <GroomingProcess>Weekly sessions to move items from Backlog to Todo/In Progress</GroomingProcess>
        <VelocityTracking>Track team velocity across all features and milestones in unified view</VelocityTracking>
    </Project>
    <IssueTracking>
        <Mapping>1 User Story = 1 Linear Issue</Mapping>
        <TaskTracking>Individual tasks tracked as sub-items or checklist items</TaskTracking>
        <CommitLinking>All commits reference Linear issue IDs for traceability</CommitLinking>
        <Labeling>Use labels for: feature-name, repository, priority, agent-role, tech-stack</Labeling>
        <MultiRepo>Support features spanning multiple existing and new repositories</MultiRepo>
    </IssueTracking>
